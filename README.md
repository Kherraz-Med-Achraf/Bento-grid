# Frontend Mentor - Bento Grid Solution

This is my solution for the [Bento Grid challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/bento-grid-RMydElrlOj). This project helped me improve my frontend skills by working on a realistic design using HTML and SCSS, and ensuring full responsiveness with Flexbox.

## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge was to build out a Bento grid layout that adjusts based on screen size. Users should be able to:

- View an optimal layout for their device’s screen size (desktop and mobile).
- Experience a fully responsive design using Flexbox.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS for styling
- Flexbox for layout

### What I learned

While working on this project, I reinforced my understanding of Flexbox. I also improved my knowledge of how to make layouts fully responsive across different device sizes.


### Continued development

I plan to continue working on Flexbox, as it provides a lot of flexibility for more complex layouts. I also want to improve my SCSS structure for better maintainability in larger projects.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks: A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me better understand how to manage layouts using Flexbox.
